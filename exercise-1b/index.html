                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Butter</b></summary>
                        <p>We need 7 tablespoons (just shy of one stick) 
                            of unsalted butter softened for the cake and 
                            another stick for the <u>vanilla buttercream frosting</u>. 
                            While nearly 2 sticks of butter sounds like a lot 
                            for a small cake, remember that this cake makes 
                            5-6 slices of cake. A regular layer cake can use 
                            up to 4 sticks (or more), if it has lots of frosting!</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Granulated Sugar</b></summary>
                        <p> Just one cup of white granulated sugar.</p>
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Eggs</b></summary>
                        <p>We need two whole eggs for this matcha cake recipe.</p>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Vanilla</b></summary>
                        <p>Pure vanilla extract compliments the green tea powder 
                            in this cake, and makes it taste like your favorite matcha latte.</p>
                    </details>
                        
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Matcha</b></summary>
                        <p>Another name for matcha is green tea powder. It's 
                            super concentrated whole green tea leaves, ground 
                            finely. You can use culinary grade matcha powder 
                            for this cake, but ensure it has a bright green color. 
                            Ceremonial matcha is going to have the brightest green 
                            color, but it also happens to be the most expensive. 
                            Just make sure it's a vibrant green color, or else your 
                            cake will be a dark forest green after baking.</p>

                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Flour</b></summary>
                        <p>The same amount of flour as sugar, one cup.</p>
                    </details>
                    

                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Baking Powder</b></summary>
                        <p>We're using baking powder instead of baking soda so that the matcha stays bright green.</p>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Buttermilk</b></summary>
                        <p>Low-fat cultured buttermilk from the store is the best 
                            thing to use here. However, you can use ⅓ cup of whole 
                            milk with ½ teaspoon of fresh lemon juice or white vinegar instead.</p>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Powdered Sugar</b></summary>
                        <p>This sugar is for the vanilla buttercream that will top the matcha cake.</p>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Heavy Cream</b></summary>
                        <p>A big splash of heavy cream makes our frosting nice and fluffy.</p>
                    </details>
                    
                    <details>
                        <summary><b>Fresh Strawberries </b></summary>
                        <p>Fresh berries are just for decoration and are completely optional, 
                            but I love the way the red strawberries and bright green cake give 
                            us Grinch vibes for Christmas.</p>

                <h2>How to Make Matcha Cake</h2>
                <h3><i>We're using an 8-inch square pan, also known as the standard brownie pan. 
                    This simple matcha cake makes a single layer and only requires one pan. 
                    However, after baking, we will slice the square in half to make two rectangles. 
                    We will stack the rectangles with buttercream to get a small layer cake shaped 
                    like a loaf. From this, you will get 5 or 6 regular cake slices.</i></h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>First, preheat oven to 325, and line the bottom of an 8-inch square pan 
                        with parchment paper. Then, lightly spray the exposed sides of the lined 
                        pan with cooking spray. Next, in a medium-size bowl, using an electric 
                        mixer on medium speed, beat together the softened butter and sugar until 
                        light and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes.
                    </li>

                    <br><br>

                    <li>
                        Add the eggs, matcha powder and vanilla, and beat just until combined.
                    </li>

                    <br><br>

                    <li>
                        In a separate small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://www.dessertfortwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Matcha-Cake-15-1536x1024.jpg" width="500px">
                    <br><br>

                    <li>
                        Add half of this flour mixture to the bowl, and stir to combine.
                    </li>

                    <br><br>

                    <li>
                        Add all of the buttermilk, and stir again. Finally, add the remaining 
                        half of the flour mixture and stir until no streaks of flour remain, 
                        but be careful not to overmix the batter.
                    </li>

                    <br><br>

                    <li>
                        Scrape the batter into the prepared pan, and bake on the middle rack 
                        for 30-33 minutes, until a toothpick inserted comes out mostly clean 
                        with only moist crumbs (not wet batter).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <img src="https://www.dessertfortwo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Matcha-Cake-6-1536x1024.jpg" width="500px">
                    <br><br>

                    <li>
                        Let the cake cool in the pan for about 15 minutes, until it starts 
                        to pull away from the edges of the pan. Then, run a knife around the 
                        edge of the cake, and lift it out of the pan and place on a cooling 
                        rack to cool completely. Once completely cool, slice the cake in half; 
                        this will make the square into two rectangles.
                    </li>

                    <br><br>
                    
                    <li>
                        Next, make the vanilla buttercream frosting by combining the softened 
                        stick of butter with powdered sugar, vanilla, and the heavy cream. 
                        Whip until fluffy and light, at least 3 minutes. Alternatively, you 
                        could make my <u>whipped cream cream cheese frosting</u>. Spread 
                        some on top of the first rectangle. Stack and use remaining buttercream and 
                        strawberries to decorate the best matcha cake ever.
