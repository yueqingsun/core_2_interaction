        <h1>The Life of a Cupcake</h1>
        <h2>Original work by Shelby Greer</h2>
        <p>
            They put me in the oven to bake.<br>
            Me, a <span id="adj1">deprived</span> and <span id="adj2">miserable</span> cake.<br>
            Feeling the heat, I started to <span id="v1">bubble</span>.<br>
            Watching the others, I knew I was in trouble.<br>
            <br>
            They opened the door and I started my life.<br>
            Frosting me with a <span id="color">silver</span> knife,<br>
            Decorating me with <span id="n1">candy</span> jewels.<br>
            The rest of my batch looked like fools.<br>
            <br>
            Lifting me up, she took off my wrapper.<br>
            Feeling the breeze, I wanted to <span id="v2">slap</span> her.<br>
            Opening her mouth with <span id="adj3">shiny</span> <span id="n2">teeth</span> inside,<br>
            This was the day this cupcake died.<br>
