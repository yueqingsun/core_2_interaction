            A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the 
            paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, 
            and the alcove where it is darkest. Whenever I see the alcove of 
            a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension 
            of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light. 
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. 
            An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so 
            that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness. 
            There is nothing more.
        </p>
        <p id="p3">
            And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the 
            crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though 
            we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with 
            the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there 
            reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness 
            immutable tranquility holds sway. 
        </p>
        <p id="p4">
            The "mysterious Orient" of which Westerners speak probably refers 
            to the uncanny silence of these dark places. And even we as children 
            would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths 
            of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated. Where 
            lies the key to this mystery? 
        </p>
        <p id="p5">
            illtimately it is the magic of shadows. Were the shadows to be 
            banished from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.           
        </p> 
        <p id="p6">
            This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the 
            light from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows 
            that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to 
            that of any wall painting or ornament. The technique seems simple, 
            but was by no means so simply achieved.
        </p>

            We can imagine with little difficulty what extraordinary pains 
            were taken with each invisible detail-the placement of the window 
            in the shelving recess, the depth of the crossbeam, the height 
            of the threshold. But for me the most exquisite touch is-the pale 
            white glow of the shoji in the study bay; I need only pause before 
            it and I forget the passage of time.
        </p>
        <p id="p8">
            The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting 
            window built to provide a place for reading. Over the years it came 
            to be regarded as no more than a source of light for the alcove; 
            but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as 
            to soften the sidelong rays from without, to filter them through paper panels.
        </p>
        <p id="p9">
            There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it 
            reaches these panels. The little sunlight from the garden that 
            manages to make its way beneath the eaves and through the corridors 
            has by then lost its power to illuminate, seems drained of the complexion of life.
        </p>
        <p id="p10">
            It can do no more than accentuate the whiteness of the paper. 
            I sometimes linger before these panels and study the surface of 
            the paper, bright, but giving no impression of brilliance.
