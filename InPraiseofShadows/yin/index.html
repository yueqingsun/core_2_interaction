            I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, 
            but I understand that in the Gothic cathedral of the West, 
            the roof is thrust up and up so as to place its pinnacle as 
            high in the heavens as possible-and that herein is thought to 
            lie its special beauty.
        </p>
        <p id="p2">
            In the temples of Japan, on the other 
            hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, 
            spacious shadows created by the eaves the rest of the structure 
            is built.
        </p>
        <p id="p3">
            Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of 
            the nobility and the houses of the common people, what first 
            strikes the eye is the massive roof of tile or thatch and the 
            heavy darkness that hangs beneath the eaves.
        </p>
        <p id="p4">
            Even at midday 
            cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath the roof's edge, 
            making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but invisible. 
        </p>
        <p id="p5">
            The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the farmhouses 
            of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like most 
            buildings of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing 
            far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the eaves.           
        </p> 
        <p id="p6">
            In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to 
            throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put 
            together a house.
        </p>
        <p id="p7">
            There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but 
            they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; 
            even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few 
            shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible.
        </p>
        <p id="p8">
            If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house 
            is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the 
            sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves.
        </p>
        <p id="p9">
            There are no doubt all sorts 
            of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact 
            that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low 
            roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain.
        </p>
        <p id="p10">
            A light room would no 
            doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room.
        </p>
        <p id="p11">
            The quality 
            that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, 
            and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover 
            beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.
